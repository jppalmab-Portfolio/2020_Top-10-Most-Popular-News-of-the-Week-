# 2020_Top-10-Most-Popular-News-of-the-Week-

## [Python|Web scraping|pandas|API Twitter]

In this project, I automatised the post of The Top 10 Most Popular Chilean News of the week.

It takes the information of a website which ranks the news by the number of posts, reposts and interactions. So I scraped the news, managed and cleaned when necessary and coded a programme which took the ranking and posted it on Twitter using the API Twitter each 1 min since the first post that announce the ranking.
