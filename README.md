**Abstract:**

This project focuses on automating the posting of the top 10 most popular news articles of the week in Chile. Leveraging web scraping techniques and Python programming, the project extracts data from a designated website that ranks news articles based on their number of posts, reposts, and interactions. The extracted data is then managed and cleaned, ensuring its quality and relevance for dissemination.

To automate the process of updating and sharing the top news, a program has been developed using the Twitter API. The program runs continuously, retrieving the latest news ranking and posting the top 10 news articles on Twitter every minute. By leveraging the power of social media and real-time updates, this project enables users to stay informed about the most engaging news stories in Chile throughout the week.

The repository includes the Python code responsible for web scraping, data management, and automated posting, allowing others to understand and adapt the solution to their specific needs. Additionally, detailed documentation provides insights into the project's objectives, methodology, and technical implementation.

Join us on this journey of automating news updates and discover the most popular news articles in Chile. Stay informed, engage with the latest stories, and explore the power of web scraping, data management, and social media integration.
